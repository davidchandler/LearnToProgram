Note: we're looking for Ruby commands for the below questions, not the actual answers, unless it's a question. 

Hint: you can type "irb" in your terminal to get a Ruby console to test things out. For multi-line code, use an editor that can run Ruby code, or copy/paste into irb.

Hint 2: you can refer to the Ruby doc for Array and Hash here: 

http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html
http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html


1. Use the "each" method of Array to iterate over [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and print out each value.

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
arr.each do |element]
  puts element
end

2. Same as above, but only print out values greater than 5.
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
arr.each do |element]
If  element > 5
   puts element    
end
end
3. Now, using the same array from #2, use the "select" method to extract all odd numbers into a new array.
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
arr.select do |n]
 n.odd?
end

4. Append "11" to the end of the array. Prepend "0" to the beginning.
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
arr << 11
arr.unshift(0)

5. Get rid of "11". And append a "3".
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
arr << 11
arr.unshift(0)
arr.pop  
arr << 3  

6. Get rid of duplicates without specifically removing any one value. 
arr.unique = returns a new array that eliminates uniques, does not modi the original array.

7. What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
hash = key value pair
Array  have order, a sequence of elements. Indexed numerically starting with 0

8. Create a Hash using both Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 syntax.
1.8  syntax -        h2 = {a: 1, b:  2, c 3}       

1.9  syntax -        h = = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}      

9. Get the value of key "b".
h[:b]  would equal 2

10. Add to this hash the key:value pair {e:5}
h[:e] = 5	

13. Remove all key:value pairs whose value is less than 3.5
h.delete_if do |k,v|   
v < 3.5
end

14. Can hash values be arrays? Can you have an array of hashes? (give examples)
h[:f]  = [1, 2, 3]   ## hash of arrays    
a = [{a:1, b:2}, {c:3, a:5}, {b:3}]     

15. Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one your like best and why.

http://ruby.railstutorial.org It seems like the easiest to use.
